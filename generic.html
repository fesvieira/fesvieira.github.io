								<p>I am a software engineer specialized in mobile app development, passionate about overcoming technical challenges and creating exceptional user experiences. My strong background in Electrical Engineering, combined with years of experience in Android and iOS development, enables me to tackle complex projects with confidence and innovation.</p>
								<p>My skills encompass a wide spectrum in the world of mobile development. In the Android ecosystem, I master technologies such as Kotlin, Java, and the latest libraries, including Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, and Room. My expertise extends to implementing robust architectures like MVVM and Clean Architecture, and I employ modern practices such as dependency injection with Dagger. Additionally, I am proficient in iOS development, using Swift and SwiftUI, with experience in patterns like MVC and VIPER.</p>
								<p>My professional journey is marked by a significant role at Champions Round, an experience that highlights my relentless pursuit of excellence. As an Android Developer, I was part of a collaborative team that contributed to the front-end development and maintenance of 5 new services. In this dynamic environment, I was responsible for significantly enhancing legacy code by migrating from Java to Kotlin and optimizing components. My expertise in Jetpack Compose, XML, Dagger, and Retrofit was crucial in creating effective and efficient solutions.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, I assisted in migrating an Android app to a Modular Architecture, applying MVVM principles. My ability to tackle complex challenges extended even to the iOS platform, where I took on the role of iOS Developer using Swift, contributing to the creation of new components and Custom Views.</p>
								<p>I am eager to continue my journey in mobile development, taking on new challenges and contributing to impactful projects. If you are seeking a dedicated, passionate professional who is always ready to embrace complex challenges, I am prepared to add value and learn even more.</p>

                <p>&#8226 Currently, there are various photovoltaic energy systems being installed in Brazil. This new
                    market
                    has experienced exponential growth in recent years, and as a result, the technology behind it is
                    continually advancing.
                </p>

                <p>&#8226 Growatt is a company that manufactures frequency inverters for solar energy. They offer a
                    variety of
                    inverter types for sale, allowing for a wide range of installations. Combining this with the rapid
                    growth of the market, there is still much room for development and maturation in this field. There
                    are few high-quality training courses available for individuals interested in this area, and
                    universities have yet to significantly incorporate this lucrative field into their electrical
                    engineering programs.
                </p>

                <p>&#8226 The aim of this project is to develop a technology related to this market, incorporating
                    intelligent systems.
